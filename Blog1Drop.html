            <h2>What is Shopify Dropshipping?</h2>
            <p>Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn't keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer. With Shopify, entrepreneurs can easily set up an online store, manage products, and process orders without handling inventory.</p>
